## Added Stuff An Fixed 👊😉👍 14-2-2022

Added Parking vehicle blips.

Added Parking place reserved, this to avoid parking on vehicle spawnpoints, you can also use this to give people there own park spot where they want, you can use a radius ofor this, 1 parking place is default radius 2

## Fixed
- finaly the floating issue is fixed.
- i change the spawns for the vehicles and did some other tricks to force it on the ground.


You have to use this to update your database table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE `player_parking` ADD `modelname` varchar(255) NOT NULL
```
