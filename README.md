## QB-parking Version 1.0 Recreated for QB-Core by MaDHouSe
This is a very awesome parking mod, that i specially made for [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core) 
This is just how you park in real live 😁 so park anywhere you want 👊😁👍
This mod is more intended for large servers, with VIP players, you can give this player an extra feature, to let them park in front of there own house, or you can use this, if you are a youtuber, and you don't want to mesh up and get your scene back togetter again, and getting al your vehicles from garage back on it place, you can also use this mod, so your scene stays how you put it, just a little thing I thought of what you also can do with this mod. 😁

This mod is also good if players crashes or if the server gets a reboot, and if you have persossion to park,
and you have parked your vehicle, then you never have to get your vehicle from the garage again, but if you do forget to park your vehicle, your vehicle can be found in garage or impound.

This is my second mod i make public, so please by kind to my 😁 i still have much to learn.



## This qb-parking system is a rebuild of esx_realparking 
[esx_realparking](https://github.com/kasuganosoras/esx_realparking/) is created by [Akkariin Meiko](https://github.com/kasuganosoras/) 
but i completely rebuild and change this system for QB-Core and i add some other features to it. 
[Akkariin Meiko](https://github.com/kasuganosoras/) did a great job to make this mod public, 
Thanks [Akkariin Meiko](https://github.com/kasuganosoras/) you're awesome!! 👊😁👍

## 🙏 How to install and do not forget anything, or it will not work, or give many errors.

- 👉 Stap 2: Copy the directory qb-parking to resources/[qb]/
- 👉 Stap 3: Add the player_parking.sql to your correct database.
- 👉 Stap 4: Add your vip players to the VipPlayer table in qb-parking/shared/config.lua there is an example how to do this.
- 👉 Stap 5: Add any recommended extra code what I say you should add.
- 👉 Stap 6: If you are 100% sure, you have done all 5 steps correctly, start the server, and enjoy 👊😎👍

- 👉 Knowledge of programming and use your brains cause i'am not going to help you install this mod, cause it's very easy to do.



## 💯 What i recommend for using this mod
- 👉 I recommend to use this mod only for vip players or for players who are most online on you server.
- 👉 Try not to spawn too many vehicles in world space, this can cause issues and hiccups. 
- 👉 It is also recommended to have a good computer/server to use this mod, cause you will need it.
- 👉 To keep the server nice and clean for everyody, use this system only for vip players. 



## 💯 I tested this mod on a computer/server with the following settings
- ✅ Prossessor: I7 12xCore
- ✅ Memory: 16 gig memory
- ✅ Graphics: GTX 1050 TI 4GB



## 🙏 Don't do this...
- 👉 DO NOT park your vehicles on roofs or that kind of stuff, just don't do it, it will work, but it breaks the mod,
- 👉 use the recommended parking spots in the world like you do in real life,
- 👉 you can do of course just park at your own house on a parking spot to keep it nice and clean for everyone.



## 💯 Police and Mechanic Impound Trigger
- ✅ You can impound this vehicles, if a user park their vehicle incorrectly, and you added the trigger correctly...
- ✅ You can give a fine, and then if you want, you can still impound this vehicle.
- ✅ If a player as police, if they can enable the hud to see the name and plate of this persons parked vehicle, by using /park-names.
- ✅ The Polices and Mechanics client side trigger event, for the police or mechanic to impount a vehicle correctly. 
- ✅ You MUST add this to your police and or mechanic impound trigger event.
- 💥 DON'T FORGET THIS PART BELOW, OR PLAYERS CAN GET THERE VEHICLE AT THE GARAGE BACK FOR FREE WHEN REJOIN .

## 👇 To keep things nice and clean for the qb-core system and database.
- ✅ Go to resources[qb]/qb-core/server/player.lua around line 506, and find, local playertables = {}. 
- ✅ This is, if we want to delete a character, we also want to delete the parked vehicles in the database,
- ✅ Place the line below at the bottom in playertables (there are more insite), so place this one at the bottom.
## resources[qb]/qb-core/server/player.lua Line:506
````
{ table = 'player_parking' },
````



## ⚙️ Database Table
